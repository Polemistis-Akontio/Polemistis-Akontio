- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Polemistis-Akontio, I am a computer science student

- Project showcase Lists:
- TechJet was a team project where we had to create an online store that utilized a database.
- EndOfTermProject was a solo project, full-stack web app of any idea we chose. The idea I had was to make a sports betting website that allowed you to find stats for NFL teams, and betting lines for current and future games. It was only partially complete for the class, it became a much bigger project than anticipated. It will be continued on when time permits.
- Midterm2 was a solo project, a full-stack web app where we were given an hour and a half to complete a set list of tasks. It was designed for you to fail, but showcases my programming abilities under pressure.
- MY-Team-Repository was a team project Java app that we had to create that allowed a business to manage personnel.
